# Conventions

This markdown file is meant to outline the conventions for workflow and processes for robot code. These rules are specific to Orbotics FRC Team 10152, but feel free to use it for your own team as well!

## Project Management

We aim to make the robot software development process similar to a traditional software engineering process. During the FRC build season (6-7 weeks) and throughout the offseason, we will be coding in "sprints". Used in professional environments, code sprints are short time-boxed periods (typically one to four weeks), where there are a defined list of tasks to be completed. For Team 10152, we will be adjusting the length of sprints based on the stage of season. For example, weekly sprints may be set during the build season due to time constraints, and monthly sprints during the offseason. 

To facilate sprints, we will be using [`Taiga`](https://taiga.io/), a free open-source project management tool. Since the Software Captain acts as a project manager, the `Scrum` template is most optimal. After kickoff weekend discussion, the Software Captain should create tickets in advance (preferably for the next 2 weeks) and assign them to the appropriate Directors and Specialists (roles specific to Team 10152).

To add a new ticket, navigate to [Team Tree](https://tree.taiga.io/project/ryanzhangofficial-orbotics-frc-team-10152/)(by invite) and click on "Add New User Story". In industry, teams call new tasks "User Stories" because new features are added in the perspective of the end-user. However, as FRC Robotics students we will refer to tasks as "tickets".

When you create a ticket, make sure to include a concise title, detailed description, and attachments if needed. Story points are a core part of the software project management. Because we are working on robot 
code, ignore the UX, Design, and Frontend rows, and only add to the Backend row. In the workplace, 1 Story Point is equivalent to a day or half a day's work. Team 10152 will regard one story point as a day's work.

As a software captain, please use your best judgement when assigning story points to tickets. However, it won't always be perfect, and that's ok. There will be huge overestimations and underestimations, but you will develop an intuition throughout the year. And most importantly, encourage communication with your team to make sure everyone can manage their workload. FRC is supposed to be a great learning experience, but lots of fun at the same time!
